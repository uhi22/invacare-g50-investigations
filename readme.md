## Pinout of the Power Module

todo

The "Power Module" is a DX-PMB2-SAS, producer "Dynamic Controls", this seems to be the same as the DX-PMB2 mentioned in Ref1.

## Bus Communication

The "DXBUS" consists of four pins:
* Ground
* 24V
* CANH
* CANL

The ground and 24V are directly connected to the battery pins of the power module.

CAN bit time is 9.5Âµs, this means the CAN baud rate is 105.29 kBaud.

### CAN messages

UCM transmit messages (found by adding a separate CAN transceiver to the UCMs CAN_TX line):

* 0x040: The main data message. Contains lot of different sub-data.
* 0x0AA: not very interesting. Always "AA 04".
* 0x29C: "03 00 1A" during run. While turning off, "03 00 10".
* 0x2B4: Constant besides a toggle bit
* 0x2BC: nearly constant, only the last byte changes sometimes.
* 0x3A4: nearly constant, only the last byte changes during shutdown.
* 0x3AC: constant "03 00 1D"

ServoLightingModule transmit messages (found by adding a separate CAN transceiver to the ServoLightingModule CAN_TX line):

* 0x010 is the only transmit message. It contains various sub-messages, e.g.
    * 30 08 00 01 after startup
    * "B0 01 00" and "B0 01 02"
    * "10 00 ....", "12 00 ..."
    * and more

MotorModule transmit messages (all remaining messages which do not come from UCM and ServoLightingModule)
* 0x008 is the only transmit message. It contains various sub-messages, e.g.
    * A3, A1, A4 after startup
    * B0 01 02
    * B0 01 10 0F ...
    * B0 01 10 0C ...
    * B0 01 20 ...
    * B0 01 22
    * B0 01 25 
    * B0 0E ...
    * 30 02 ...
    * and more

## UCM (Joystick Control Module)

CAN_TX: Is the pin 1 of the 74HC02 on the sub-board.


## Diagnostic Connector

according to ref1, this is RS232.
